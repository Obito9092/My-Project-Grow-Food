Hey 👋 My name is Ayman, a Roblox programmer. I'm experimenting and learning every day. I love working on small projects and developing my skills in Luau and Roblox Studio. I'm still a beginner, but I'm working hard and trying to reach the best level.

I enjoy writing scripts and GUIs, and experimenting with new game ideas. I often work alone, but I help others when I can. My goal is to build great games and improve my skills step by step.

If you've made it this far, welcome to my profile ✨.
